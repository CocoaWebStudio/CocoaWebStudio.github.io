  postVue:
    'First of all we can start by saying that VUE is a progressive open source Javascript framework, this means that it works according to the need you have to make a project on the web, from a simple page, to Single Page Aplication (SPA) projects o Server-rendering, which has many features that provide many benefits when developing an application and is what has made us give it a chance for our projects. Among its most relevant features we can say that the learning curve is very fast, since it combines many positive things from other javascript frameworks and other improved features that make it special. Its syntax and directives are quite simple to understand, once you look at them and know what each one is for, you will instantly understand how to use them. It is not necessary to use Webpack to make basic use of vue and create a simple application, just importing the library into HTML, since a CDN is sufficient. Its structure is very organized because it works through components that can be reusable, static or dynamic depending on what you decide to do, this is a great advantage since it saves you a lot when writing and we know that in the world of programming the save us time and memory space in rewriting code is quite important. Vue has a life cycle, which allows us to know when we are in the life cycle of the component to be able to access it and its calls correctly. The way to work the modular components in vue makes it stand out quite a bit, since the separation of style, HTML and Javascript is quite clear, through a file with a .vue extension and within this separated by tags, and thanks to a loader of Webpack, which will be responsible for extracting and separating each one from its side, this makes the job easier and easier to understand, if we have a team which works separately each modular part of the component will be easy to access and understand this structure proposed vue. We can say that the plugin system to add more functionalities is quite efficient, since as our application grows we can incorporate more files with .vue files and install the plugins according to what that application may allow us, for example, if Our application consists of several pages we can use vue-router to make routing easier for the user. It is also quite good when connecting to any database or performing Apis that our application requires. In summary, if you need to develop something very basic, moderately complex or very complex Vue is perfect, we fall short with all the benefits that Vuejs has, and these are some of the many features by which it is one of our favorite Javascript frameworks and which we bet a lot and we know that over time more and more people join this community, so we invite you to try and start using it.'
